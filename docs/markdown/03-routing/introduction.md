# How works the routing in Qwik city

Routing in Qwik city is file system based, exactly like Next.

Files and directories in the src/route directory have a role in the routing of your application. <br/><br/>

- **directories**: Define the url segments to match by the router. <br/><br/>
- **index.tsx**:  Define a page for the route. <br/><br/>
- **index.ts**: Defin ean endpoint <br/><br/>
- **layout.tsx**: Define a layout for the route. <br/>
